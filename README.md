🍿 Netflix Movie Recommendation System
Welcome to the Netflix Recommendation System, where machine learning meets movie magic 🎥✨.
This project is a Content-Based Filtering model built to recommend movies similar to your favorite ones. Instead of relying on user ratings (Collaborative Filtering), this system reads the content — think genres, plots, keywords — and finds patterns that align with your movie preferences.

💡 What is a Recommendation System?
A recommendation system is like your digital movie buddy. It answers questions like:

"You liked Inception? You’ll probably enjoy Interstellar."

"Into crime thrillers with a tech twist? Here's more."

In Netflix, there are multiple types of recommendation engines:

Collaborative Filtering (based on user behavior)

Content-Based Filtering (based on movie metadata)

Hybrid Systems (best of both)

This project focuses on Content-Based Filtering—great when user history is limited or unavailable.

🧠 Intuition Behind the Project
Imagine your friend says, "I love The Matrix!" — How would you recommend a movie?

You’d probably look for:

Sci-fi elements

A dystopian or futuristic theme

Tech or AI concepts

A cerebral or twisty plot

We’re replicating that same logic with data.

We:

Extract metadata about each movie (genre, keywords, plot summary).

Convert text into numbers using NLP tools (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer).

Measure similarity between movies using Cosine Similarity.

Recommend the top N most similar titles.

That’s exactly what this model does—at scale and with machine learning precision.

🔍 Project Pipeline
Here’s a breakdown of what happens under the hood:

1. Data Loading
We load a dataset containing movie titles, genres, descriptions, and more.

python
Copy
Edit
movies = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')
2. Data Cleaning & Feature Selection
We clean the dataset and select features we’ll use to generate similarity:

Title

Genre

Overview

Keywords

We then merge them into a single "tags" column.

python
Copy
Edit
movies['tags'] = movies['overview'] + movies['keywords'] + movies['genres']
3. Vectorization (Turning Text into Numbers)
Using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF, we convert the text into a matrix of numbers that a machine can understand.

Each movie becomes a vector in a high-dimensional space, and words like “alien”, “space”, or “romance” become features.

python
Copy
Edit
cv = CountVectorizer(max_features=5000, stop_words='english')
vectors = cv.fit_transform(movies['tags']).toarray()
4. Similarity Computation
We now compute pairwise cosine similarity between all movie vectors to understand which ones are closest in meaning.

python
Copy
Edit
similarity = cosine_similarity(vectors)
5. Recommendation Function
We build a simple function where, given a movie title, it:

Finds its vector

Computes similarity with every other movie

Returns the top 10 most similar titles

python
Copy
Edit
def recommend(movie):
    index = movies[movies['title'] == movie].index[0]
    distances = similarity[index]
    movie_list = sorted(list(enumerate(distances)), reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[1])[1:11]
    for i in movie_list:
        print(movies.iloc[i[0]].title)

🚀 Future Upgrades
Here’s how we can take this system from good to elite:

✅ Add a web interface using Streamlit or Flask

✅ Use TMDb API to pull real-time posters and movie info

✅ Combine with Collaborative Filtering for hybrid recommendations

✅ Deploy on Heroku or HuggingFace Spaces
